// EXPLANATIONS
"JScoreDesc"="The J-Score represents the percentile battery life you see relative to all other devices being measured by Carat. \n\nSo, if you have a J-Score of 50, that means your expected battery life is better than half of our users; a score of 99 means you have better battery life than 99%% of our users. Of course, a single number does not provide a complete description of your battery life. \n\nA low J-Score could mean that your device is using a big battery inefficiently or a small battery with average efficiency. Similarly, a high J-Score could simply mean that you don\'t use your device heavily. Carat computes a huge variety of statistics, and the J-Score is just one of them.";

"MemoryDesc"="The operating system (OS) classifies your device\'s physical memory as either used or free. If memory is used, it means there is currently data there that belongs to some process (like one of your apps or the OS, itself). When the device runs out of free memory, it needs to make room so it can store new data, which means closing apps that might be running in the background or asking your apps to throw away data they aren\'t using. The OS then further subcategorizes used memory as being either active or inactive, depending on whether it was accessed recently or not, respectively. When the OS runs out of free memory, it starts reclaiming inactive memory. When you open a bunch of apps, the fraction of used memory may increase; when the apps you have running are working with lots of data (often an energy-intensive task), the fraction of active memory may increase. The OS also preloads often used applications into memory, shortening wait times.";
"CpuUsageDesc"="CPU Usage shows a percentage of how much of your device's processing power is currently being used. High percentages mean that the device is fully loaded in terms of processing power, such as when playing games or installing new applications.";
"WellBehavedDesc"="These apps use an appropriate amount of energy and don't usually require user intervention.";

This average rate excludes times that your device was idle and, as always, cannot account for behavior when Carat was not running.
