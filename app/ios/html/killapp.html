        <h3>How to Kill / Restart an App</h3>
        <p>From your home screen, press the home button twice. You should see a Process Manager that looks something like this:<p>
        <center><img src="procmanager1.png"></center>
        <p>If necessary, swipe back and forth to locate the app you want to close. When you've found it, press and hold on the app icon until a red circle appears in the corner of the icon:<p>
        <center><img src="procmanager2.png"></center>
        <p>Press this red circle. Once you are done killing apps, press the home button to close the Process Manager. If you were trying to restart the app, now simply open it again, as usual.</p>
